Basic Functionality:
- The app should have a main screen displaying a list of to-do items.
- Each to-do item should have a title and a timestamp of when it was created.
- Users should be able to add and delete to-do items.

I want to use as few libraries as possible, especially on data layer, and no third party library is used in this project
Library dependency
- UI - Jetpack Compose, Material 3
- ViewModel
